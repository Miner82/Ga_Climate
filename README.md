In this project, we wanted to investigate the effect of temperature and rainfall on crop yields, for two typical agricultural
regions in the State of Georgia: Sumter county (home of Plains and peanut/cotton production), and Toombs, source of Vidalia onions.
Happily, the Univ. of GA agricultural research and climate studies faculty were able to provide weather data by county from the early 90's 
to 2010.    For crop yield data, the USDA crop census provides a county/state breakdown for crop commodities.
